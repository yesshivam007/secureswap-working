                <p>This policy outlines the conditions under which deals can be cancelled and refunds may be issued through the SecureSwap platform.</p>

                <h2>1. Deal Cancellation</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>**Before Payment:** A deal can usually be cancelled by either party before the Buyer makes the payment into escrow.</li>
                    <li>**After Payment, Before Delivery Confirmation:** Cancellation may be possible upon mutual agreement between the Buyer and Seller. If agreed, SecureSwap will refund the amount held in escrow to the Buyer, minus any applicable non-refundable service fees.</li>
                    <li>**After Delivery Confirmation:** Once the Seller confirms delivery/shipment, cancellation is generally not possible through the platform, and the process moves to Buyer Receipt Confirmation or Dispute Resolution.</li>
                    <li>**Rejection:** If the 'Other Party' rejects a deal during the confirmation stage, the deal is considered cancelled.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>2. Refunds</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>**Mutual Cancellation:** If a deal is cancelled mutually after payment but before delivery confirmation, the Buyer will receive a refund of the escrowed amount, less applicable fees.</li>
                    <li>**Dispute Resolution:** Refunds may be issued to the Buyer or Seller based on the outcome of a formal dispute resolution process handled by SecureSwap, in accordance with our Terms of Service and Dispute Resolution Policy (to be created). Evidence may be required from both parties.</li>
                    <li>**Non-Delivery:** If the Seller fails to deliver the item/service or confirm delivery within a reasonable timeframe (as determined by SecureSwap or defined in the deal terms if applicable), the Buyer may be eligible for a full refund after a review process.</li>
                    <li>**Item Not As Described:** If the Buyer receives an item significantly different from the description and raises a valid dispute, a partial or full refund may be issued upon review and potentially requiring the item's return.</li>
                    <li>**Seller Payout:** Funds are only released to the Seller after the Buyer confirms receipt or a dispute is resolved in the Seller's favor. Refunds are generally processed back to the Buyer's original payment method where feasible.</li>
                </ul>
                 <p>Processing times for refunds may vary depending on the payment method and banking institutions involved.</p>
                 <p>SecureSwap service fees are generally non-refundable unless stated otherwise.</p>

                <h2>3. Dispute Resolution</h2>
                 <p>If parties cannot agree on cancellation or if there is an issue with the transaction (e.g., item not received, item not as described), users should utilize the SecureSwap dispute resolution mechanism (details to be provided in a separate policy or within the platform).</p>
